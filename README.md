Crystal Collector is a simple game created to test basic Javascript/JQuery skills. On page load, the game picks a random number from 1-100 and assigns the four crystals random values from 1-10. As the user, it is your job to match the initial randomly generated number by clicking the crystals. As you click the crystals, a counter will keep track of the sum of your clicks!
